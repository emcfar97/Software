# GUI
This is a suite of files for a graphical user interface that navigates and selects from a gallery of images for the purposes of illustration reference and practice. Originally implemented in Tkinter and SQLite, the project is now coded in PyQt6 and MySQL.\
Consists of six applications:
### [Deep Learning](https://github.com/users/emcfar97/projects/5)
Experimental. App for GUI-ifying the machine learning process, a la PerceptiLabs.
### [Manage Database](https://github.com/users/emcfar97/projects/4)
Consists of a lefthand gallery of images and a righthand display for selected image. Allows deletion and updating of records, as well as a slideshow function that can display images and videos in fullscreen. 
### [Gesture Draw](https://github.com/users/emcfar97/projects/9)
App for easy gesture drawing (drawing the pose of a figure in a short amount of time). Allows user to select images and specify the amount of time for each gesture draw.
### [Slideshow](https://github.com/users/emcfar97/projects/8)
App for displaying both images and video. Currently only works with Manage Database.
### [Video Splitter](https://github.com/users/emcfar97/projects/3)
Experimental. App for splitting video into clips using the scenedetect module.
# Machine Learning
An exploratory dive into machine learning using Tensorflow and PyTorch. Due to memory constraints, most of the important files (models, datasets, etc.) are not stored on GitHub.
# Web Development
### [MBTI Visualizer](https://github.com/users/emcfar97/projects/3)
# Webscraping
A group of functions for scraping images off of various imagehosting sites, which are then used for the GUI and Machine Learning projects.
# School
A set of projects that I've developed, either individually or as a team, over the course of my college career.
